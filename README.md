# Handheld-Air-Puff-Tonometer
For SIH 2024

Ideated and designed a new and innovative solution for a handheld air puff tonometer as a part of the Smart India Hackathon. It would provide patients with sever glaucoma an easier way to monitor their glaucoma. It conceptualized a 97% decrease in cost from a conventional air puff tonometer.

Our solution offers non-contact intraocular pressure measurement, significantly reducing the risk of bacterial infection by 90-95% compared to traditional at-home tonometers, which require corneal contact and sterilization.  . 

This non-invasive approach simplifies eye pressure monitoring, aiding in the early detection of glaucoma. 
The device features a self-alignment mechanism, utilizing forehead and cheekbone references for accurate positioning. 
It is compact, self-powered, and designed for portability, making it ideal for travel.  

The system maintains a comprehensive database of previous readings, allowing for trend analysis and more precise detection of glaucoma onset.
Also aimed to provide advanced data analytics services, offering comprehensive reports and actionable insights based on intraocular pressure patterns. 
Through continuous monitoring and data collection, our solution would allow for early detection of glaucoma trends, enabling timely interventions and more effective treatment plans.
It would also allow for self monitoring at the patient's home, and also make glaucoma screenings more accessible in government hospitals and underserved communities through field visits.
